These files will read the temporature from a DS1624 which is a cheap and easy to source Board Mount Temperature Sensor

They will then indicate the temperature by lighting up either a Blue, Green or Red LED.

There are 2 varients of the TempRead program, but I cannot remember what the difference is and I am to tired to check right now.

There is a third program, TempTweet.py that does the same as the others, but tweets the results.

The scripts are launched using the shell scripts (.sh files) which gives control of the log's that are produced so diagnostics may be performed.

LEDTest.py somply flashes the LED's to make sure they are working.

Crontab entries.txt shows the crontab entries that launch the various scripts.
