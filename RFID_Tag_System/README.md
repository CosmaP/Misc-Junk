# RFID Tag System

This is very early stage, even earlier than I thought, but it works after a fashion.</br>
</br>
RDID-RC522.png   -  Is wireing diagram for my test rig</br>
TagSystem.py &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -  Is the start of my system.  It was set up to read and write to my SQL and</br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  has a link to where some of the code came from.</br>
TagSystem_Orr.py -  Is a file that does work, that I plagurised for my purpose (from a friend).</br>
Test.py  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -  Is a sanity check to confirm I have not borked the RFID tags or reader.</br>
