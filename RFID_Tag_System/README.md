# RFID Tag System

This is very early stage, even earlier than I thought, but it works after a fashion.

RDID-RC522.png   -  Is wireing diagram for my test rig
TagSystem.py     -  Is the start of my system.  It was set up to read and write to my SQL and has a
                    link to where some of the code came from
TagSystem_Orr.py -  Is a file that does work, that I plagurised for my purpose (from a friend)
Test.py          -  Is a sanity check to confirm I have not borked the RFID tags or reader.
